module 12 
Mongo was not working so I referenced the links from class
The Mongo links from class no longer work. I had Mongo downloaded already from class it wasnâ€™t working right. I tried to use the links from class and they no longer work.  Maybe tell someone?
I referenced: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsZR0KtRTR8
I wrote the code as if it was working but then I also read in the file with pandas and then worked with it that way 
I'm sure my attempts are worth at least one point 
thank you
