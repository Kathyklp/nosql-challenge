I’m sorry there are so many files. I am having trouble with Github.
Please use the following files that are the most up-to-date:

I am submitting this again to make sure that I included the correct html link. I was not able to use the website url submission.

I received this from Cortney Totty: “In order for an assignment to count towards gradution, it requires any score above 0. Regarding the rubric and challenge grade you are correct. Your score is is based on the rubric.” I am sure I have completed enough to get the one point required to get credit for the assignment. 
I will complete the assignments later, on my own. I need to ensure that I have one point on each assignment to graduate. Based on the rubric I completed the following:
Requirements
Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up (15 points)     completed
Include the mongoimport command text you used to import establishments.json in a markdown cell at the beginning of your Jupyter notebook file (3 points)    completed
The mongoimport command text correctly drops any existing establishments collection before importing establishments.json into MongoDB (2 points) 
The database is named uk_food and the collection is named establishments (2 points) completed
Correctly imports PyMongo and Pretty Print (2 points)  completed
An instance of the Mongo Client is created (1 point)  completed
Lists the databases you have in Mongo, which includes uk_food (1 point)  completed
Lists the collection(s) in the uk_food database, which includes establishments in the output (1 point)
Uses find_one() and pprint to display one document in the establishments collection (2 points)
The establishments collection is assigned to a variable (1 point)

Thank you for your time. Kathy
